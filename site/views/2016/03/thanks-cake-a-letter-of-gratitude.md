# Thanks Cake: A Letter of Gratitude

## A brief history

My programming career, like that of many other developers, has evolved significantly
over time. I loved programming ActionScript, a language that was (and perhaps
still is) in my opinion, a fantastic OOP derivation of ECMAScript. ActionScript
3 introduced me to OOP concepts. I had never gone to school to learn how to make
computers do things, my education was coming in small bursts when I needed to do
something I didn't know how to do. Eventually I needed to do server-side tasks.
At the time, people around me were using classic ASP, so that ended up being the
first server-side language I learned.

Then bliss. PHP. The any man's language. It was everywhere, and everyone was
hiring developers who could hack some 90s taped together table based image swapping
piece of shit website. I ticked the box, I "knew" a server-side language. Yeah,
I "knew" ASP, but PHP was all the rage! I loved programming in ActionScript way
more, but there was just a flood of PHP jobs it would've been foolish not to at
least dabble.

At this point I was mostly self taught. I didn't have any real programming
mentors to guide me along, so I kept battling through freelance gigs, trying to
meet each challenge head on. I took to forums (haha) to post questions and learn
from others. I also would attempt to answer questions I didn't know, causing me
to dive into code I didn't understand to solve *someone else's problem*. **This
became my best learning tool, as it drove me to venture into areas I would have
never touched.**

## My first job

A friend approached me one day with a job opportunity. Having decided that
competing for freelance projects against offshore programming houses wasn't that
much fun, I thought I'd go for it. It came with an interesting requirement:
**CakePHP**. I had used CMS frameworks like Joomla before, but this was the first
I had ever heard of an application development framework.

The app was written in 1.1 and needed maintenance. I had no idea what to expect
from a framework like this. I jumped onto the Cake site and read the book.
*MC-what? ACLs? What's an ACO again?* I read it again. And again. And again.

I was introduced to an incredible number of new concepts in a matter of minutes.
Some took longer than others to grasp. Others just clicked. All of them felt
right, and I realized PHP might just be able to replace my beloved ActionScript.
It was fun, I was building things quickly, and, most importantly, I was learning.
I learned about security, about basic programming concepts, about standards -
it was fantastic.

## Digging into CakePHP

Back in the day, Cake had an obscene amount of magic in it. I thought the term
"automagically" was cute, until it appeared in the book several billion times<sup>1</sup>.
While magic is nice, when it doesn't work, it blows. I ran into a few things that
just didn't work, so I  was pushed into the next step in my career: talking
directly to very smart people. I had to submit a bug report. I had to *not* look
stupid. I drafted a report. I hovered over the submit button. I clicked.

The initial apprehension subsided and I submitted more reports. I learned how to
make a patch (SVN and manual patches seem so archaic now). I dove into the code
and learned how the magic worked, and learned a ton of PHP in the process, which
was far more valuable than knowing how to use a single framework.

A while later an unexpected email came from @jose_zap (JosÃ© Lorenzo), a still-maintainer of
the project. He asked me to be a core member! **I had made it**. I felt like I was
recognized as a peer and was part of a team of people who were clearly smarter
than me. They became my mentors, perhaps unbeknownst to them. I remember @mark_story
(Mark Story) taught me the git CLI when the project moved away from the
hell that was subversion. I asked a question in the dev channel, and got a
friendly answer. They taught me about unit testing, which I quickly fell in love
with and have been advocating ever since.

These people not only were giving away their time, *they gave
away their knowledge*. I was fortunate enough to be allowed to contribute some
great things to Cake thanks to their tutelage.

## I Cake Therefore I Am

While I love working with CakePHP, the tools I've learned from learning CakePHP
led me to program in many different frameworks, write better agnostic PHP, learn
tons of new concepts, and have an overall better understanding of web development.

CakePHP, the framework, was certainly a huge stepping stone towards becoming
the programmer I am today. CakePHP, the community, however, provided much more
invaluable *tools* that filled in the gaps that self teaching leaves.
