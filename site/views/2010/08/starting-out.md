# Starting out

My experience with Croogo has been very pleasant so far. I'm still learning my way around the code-side of things. That is, creating templates, plugins, etc. It looks incredibly promising.

I decided to put the blog up before actually completing a template. I have a lot of ideas and information to share that I've developed over the last year. A lot has been lost, unfortunately, so I'm going to at least keep some sort of history here.

Since putting the site live, I've noticed it's pretty slow. I'll work on that.

So, for now, default Croogo it is!
