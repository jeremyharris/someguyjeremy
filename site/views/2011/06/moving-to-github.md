# Moving to Github

After hosting my open source projects and plugins on [Codaset ](http://codaset.com)for some time now, I've decided to move them to [Github](http://github.com). There are a few reasons for this, which I'll explain. Before I go into detail, however, let me just say that I'm extremely thankful and supportive of [Joel Moss](http://twitter.com/#!/joelmoss)(creator of Codaset) and his work to improve the git hosting world.

I've also been very happy with Joel's email customer support. He's answered the few support emails I've sent promptly. But it just seems that in the past few months, there's been a steady decline in keeping Codaset up. He's been very open about his business, which I like, but I feel like the project may not be getting all the love it needs to compete with sites like Github.
### Tickets

The main reason I started using Codaset was because of the ticketing system. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I didn't feel like I needed to pay for something as robust as[Lighthouse](http://lighthouseapp.com/) (the ticketing system used by [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org))</span>, (NOTE: As pointed out by [Ceeram](http://twitter.com/#!/ceeram) in the comments, Lighthouse is free for open source projects. However, it's nice to have everything integrated, including private projects, so I probably wouldn't have moved to Lighthouse anyway) but I wanted something a little more feature rich than what Github offered at the time. Codaset filled that gap quite nicely, and I've enjoyed the improvements that have come during my time there.

Github [recently released](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation) their new Issues system, which now suits my needs just fine.

### Speed

Github is much faster than Codaset. Browsing around is much faster, especially when browsing the source code. And why shouldn't it be? Github's server power is probably much greater than Codaset's. Browsing source code on Codaset is an almost painful experience for me. It's just too hard to ignore. Especially when one of the primary purposes of a git hosting site is to facilitate the distribution of source code.

### Updates

Github updates things at an incredible rate. This is no doubt because of the size of their team. As an example, there was recently a post on [Github bullies](http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1306816425.html). It's worth a read not just for the context, but because in this world of make-believe and magic (the internet), it's become all too easy to push people around, hiding behind some silly alias, and this post brings some very important things to light. Anyway, Github's recent [feature addition](https://github.com/blog/862-block-the-bullies)*may* have been a direct response to this, and if it was it was incredibly prompt. If not, it's just another example of Github continually updating their software to make it work better for its users.

The thing that really prompted the move is [this ticket](http://codaset.com/codaset/codaset/tickets/902). It's titled "Can't download any source." Obviously downloading OSS source code is mildly important. For those who don't use git, it basically made the repos useless as far as distribution goes. If you follow the ticket's timeline, you'll see that it took nearly two weeks to fix this issue. Now, Joel's just one guy. He also does this on the side, as far as I know. So I can't blame him, and I really am able to sympathize. My side projects and my participation in Cake has suffered a bit over the last few months due to outside factors.

Take Github's issue a little while ago with a [similar issue](http://twitter.com/#!/github/status/80668806120357888). They [fixed it](http://twitter.com/#!/github/status/80677173677137920) in about 30 minutes. Again, more people and dedicated (paid) hours.

Unfortunately, this was the straw that broke the camels back.

### So, that's that

Let me just say, I'm a loyal person, especially with my services. I hate the idea of leaving one for another. But for things that affect my productivity and my business, it's hard to ignore. I love the little guy, though (heck, I am a little guy), which makes it that much harder. It's worth noting that my private repos will remain there for now.

So, beginning today, I'll only be supporting my OSS projects on Github. A nice perk is that my plugins will be indexed by [Cake Packages](http://cakepackages.com/) now.
Thanks Codaset for providing me with awesome software, even if it wasn't forever.
