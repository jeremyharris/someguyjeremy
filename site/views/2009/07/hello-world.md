# Hello World

The quintessential first post! I'm planning on actually updating this blog with relevant posts and articles about CakePHP and programming in general.

Two things I would like to say: I submitted my first (of hopefully many) modification to the CakePHP core. Don't be surprised if you find me unnecessarily giddy when it gets applied. Secondly, I have purchased my ticket to [CakeFest ](http://cakefest.org/)which, I expect, will be utterly fantastic.
